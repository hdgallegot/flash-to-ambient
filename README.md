# Flash-To-Ambient Model

In the procces of generating digital images from scences sometimes the level of light very low and insufficient to get a properly digitization of the image. Thus, noisy and blurry areas are produced in the image. We can handle this situation with an external illumination device such as a camera flash, but here is when other challenges are generated. The camera flash can be blinding and too strong for a scene, so instead of enhancing the low light image, sometimes, it causes very bright and very dark areas. Another problem in the flash image is the shadows. These shadows sometimes cover considerable areas of the scene depending on the direction of the camera flash. And finally, getting the correct tone of the scene objects in a flash image becomes very difficult, because the color of objects changes due the flash illumination. In contrast, in an ambient image, the illumination of the objects not depends so much of their position, because the available light can be more evenly distributed.
